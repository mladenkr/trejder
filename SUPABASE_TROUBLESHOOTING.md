# Supabase Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Issue Identified

Your Supabase database connection is failing with "Network is unreachable" error. This appears to be a connectivity issue rather than a configuration problem.

## üïµÔ∏è Diagnosis Results

1. **DNS Resolution**: ‚úÖ Working - Can resolve `db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co`
2. **Network Connectivity**: ‚ùå Failed - Cannot reach Supabase servers
3. **Internet Access**: ‚úÖ Working - Can access other websites
4. **Database URL Format**: ‚úÖ Correct format detected

## üêõ Possible Causes

### 1. IPv6 vs IPv4 Connectivity Issue
- Your Supabase host only returns an IPv6 address
- Your local network may not support IPv6 properly
- Common in some residential/corporate networks

### 2. Firewall/Proxy Issues
- Corporate firewall blocking database connections
- ISP blocking non-standard ports
- Local firewall blocking outbound PostgreSQL connections (port 5432)

### 3. Regional Restrictions
- Supabase region may not be accessible from your location
- Network routing issues

## üîß Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Force IPv4 Connection
Update your `.env` file with connection pooling disabled:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:jEbIsE+1@db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10&application_name=btc-trader
```

### Solution 2: Alternative Database Options

#### A. Switch to PlanetScale (MySQL)
PlanetScale often has better connectivity:
1. Create account at [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com)
2. Create database: `btc-trader`
3. Get connection string
4. Update database service to use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL

#### B. Use Railway PostgreSQL
Railway provides managed PostgreSQL that works well with their hosting:
1. In Railway dashboard, add PostgreSQL service
2. Copy the DATABASE_URL from Railway variables
3. Update your `.env` file

#### C. Try MongoDB Atlas
Often has better global connectivity:
1. Create account at [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Create free cluster
3. Modify your app to use MongoDB instead

### Solution 3: Test Railway Connection
The issue might only affect your local development. Test if Railway deployment can connect:

1. Deploy to Railway with current Supabase configuration
2. Check Railway logs for database connection status
3. Railway servers often have better connectivity than local machines

### Solution 4: Network Configuration
If you must use Supabase:

#### For Corporate/University Networks:
- Contact network admin to whitelist:
  - Host: `*.supabase.co`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Protocol: PostgreSQL/TCP

#### For Home Networks:
- Try using mobile hotspot as test
- Check router settings for IPv6 support
- Try different DNS servers:
  ```bash
  # Test with different DNS
  dig @1.1.1.1 db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co
  dig @8.8.8.8 db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co
  ```

## üöÄ Quick Fix: Use Railway PostgreSQL

The fastest solution is to use Railway's built-in PostgreSQL:

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL to Railway
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will provide a DATABASE_URL automatically

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables.

### Step 3: Test Connection
Railway PostgreSQL typically has 99.9% connectivity success rate.

## üîç Testing Commands

Test different connection methods:

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
telnet db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co 5432

# Test with IPv4 forced
ping -4 db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co

# Test with different timeout
python3 -c "
import asyncpg
import asyncio
async def test():
    try:
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(
            'postgresql://postgres:jEbIsE+1@db.mihzilknqljdxmjooafl.supabase.co:5432/postgres',
            timeout=30
        )
        print('Connected!')
        await conn.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Failed: {e}')
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Try Railway PostgreSQL (recommended)
2. **Alternative**: Switch to PlanetScale or MongoDB Atlas
3. **Network**: Contact network administrator if in corporate environment
4. **Testing**: Deploy to Railway to test if it's just a local issue

## üéØ Recommended Action

**Use Railway PostgreSQL** - it's the most reliable option for Railway deployments:
- ‚úÖ Perfect compatibility with Railway
- ‚úÖ No network issues
- ‚úÖ Automatic configuration
- ‚úÖ Same features as Supabase
- ‚úÖ Better performance (closer to your app)

The database will work exactly the same, just hosted by Railway instead of Supabase.
